		  Hello welcome to my Hopes And Dreams website. My name is Lily Huang and I am currently a college student.The main club I worked with was NJPRIG helping them with the zero hunger project. 
		  However, since Covid had started I quit NJPRIG club because of the weird meeting dates and I feel online clubs are a waste of time. 
		 </p>
		 <p>
		  My major is Computer Science and Applied Math.<br>
		  In the future I wish to be an actuary or an app developer.<br>
		  During my free like to read science fiction books such as the Hunger Games.
